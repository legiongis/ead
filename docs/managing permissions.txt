This app will have two types of authenticated ("logged in") user permissions: 'edit' and 'rdm'. 'Edit' permission allows a user to create new resources or edit existing resources. 'RDM' permission allows a user to access the RDM (Reference Data Manager) to change dropdown menus and concepts. By default the app will have an 'editor' user and an 'admin' user, as described below. Any number of new users can be created, and their permission levels individually defined.

Users and permissions are managed in the Django admin page, which can be accessed at <localhost>:8000/admin. To create a new user, you must sign in to that page as the 'admin' user. Once you make a new user, you can assign them the desired permission levels, as well as a name and e-mail address. Usually, Django allows you to give users access to the admin page by designating them as 'staff' users. In the case of the EAD app, this is not sufficient. Use the default 'admin' user for all user management.

The default users, which should serve as models for new users that will be created, are:

1) admin (default password=admin)
permissions granted: 'edit' and 'rdm'
  This user can create new resources ('edit'), access the RDM ('rdm'), and access the admin page.

2) editor (default password=editor)
permissions granted: 'edit'
  This user can create new resources, but cannot edit the RDM, nor access the admin page.

Note that there is also an 'anonymous' user, which is assign to any visitor that is not logged in. This user has no 'edit' or 'rdm' privileges, and it should always stay that way.
