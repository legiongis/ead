Github is used for adding changes to the software. Weekstmp user (on the desktop in the TMP office) has a local repository: ArchesEADGithub, which contains the latest software. This is connected to legiongis EAD github repository (https://github.com/legiongis/ead. 
Changes can be checked using the interface 'SourceTree'. By using refresh and pull commands can pull down the changes into my local repo from Adam's repo. 

You can upload any changes you make to the software by also using source tree:
Update program
Stage it
Commit it
Push to repo on Github 


To update the Arches EAD software from github, use the console app: 'VMware vSphere Client' and navigate to the development server L-Django-T

git pull to pull new code changes from github.
